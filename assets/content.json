I have won the peace prize last year in 1964, this has shown a person of any race can do anything they put their mind to. Through the help help of the African American community standing up for the truth, we have come a far ways. People have seemed to love my dream speech in 1963, which have started a revolution for equality. I hope more and more people stand up for what is right, as I feel my life will be drawn short soon."

Thousands of kids died each year and the disease of Polio had reached maximum seriousness before the vaccine was developed."

This is the worst air pollution crisis in Europe to this day and it killed 8,000 to 12,000 people and around 4,000 babies died prematurely. Following the mass tragedy, Parliament passed The Clean Air Act of 1956 and prevented the burning of coal around an urban area and was the first step towards clean energy efforts in Europe."

Polio has affected humanity throughout history and can cause paralysis. The disease became widespread across the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
