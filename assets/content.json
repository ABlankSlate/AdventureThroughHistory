The Soviets helped install a communist regime in the North and the United States supported the South militarily and financially. The American intervention changed the war completely as they and South Korea marched into North Korea. This resulted in a long three year stalemate in which there were many casualties for both sides.

The United States made threats of economic sanctions towards Britain and France if they did not withdraw their troops in an effort to avoid an all out nuclear war and the threats worked."

This made the United States uneasy because they had supported Batista in years past and they believed that Castro would carry out attacks on American investments and property in the country. Support for his revolution grew due to corruption, greed, and brutality within the Batista regime and the entire country celebrated when Batista was overthrown. When Castro officially took power, he made an alliance with communist Russia and became an enemy of the United States."
